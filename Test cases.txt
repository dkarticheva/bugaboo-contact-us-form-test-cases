My motivation when selecting Automation candidates is to ensure the user would be able to do their job without encountering any blocking bugs.
This means we need to ensure the main flow works correctly.
Having all the FAQ present is important as the user could find their answer and not waist time to contact the company.
If they do need to contact the company, we need to ensure the form can be filled and sent in without an issue.
As the email is the point of contact for later on, we need to make sure only valid emails are filled in 
(this I think would be better tested with a less expensive tets than UI test for exmaple unit/integration) 
and the verify email has the same email input (no test for this present above, 
but I would advocate for unit/integration on that as well).
If the test framework is mature enough (meanining testing the upload of a video is easy enough) 
and discussions with product/dev team have made clear the video is a very important part, 
then I'd automate tests around that as well.
